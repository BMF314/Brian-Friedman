## **Hey! My name is Brian. Let's get started.**

In 2017, I moved to Connecticut from San Francisco where I am now the VP of Digital Innovation at [**Aventri**](https://www.aventri.com), leading the company’s digital strategic objectives. In this role, I work to identify and articulate new product and growth opportunities that can transform—and even disrupt—the events market. Recently, I finished writing my book, Takeaways: Secret truths from leading a startup, that will be released in early 2019. I feature my top insights weekly on my personal blog: OWN IT.

Previously, I was the CEO and cofounder of LOOPD, the emerging leader in offline analytics that utilized socially smart wearables and actionable metrics to help marketers understand, target, and interact with customers. Loopd brought a unique twist to analytics by facilitating and documenting two-way live engagement between customers and others at corporate events. 

All of this hard work demands an outlet for release, and I am an avid fan of action sports and outdoor activity. I am a former competitive snowboarder and now I enjoy kiteboarding, mountain biking, and international adventuring, having recently logged trips to India, Iceland, China, Portugal, and Japan.

I like to make cool visualizations in my free time. Take a look at this interesting breakdown of college enrollment at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA.


<iframe title="Chart: 2017 Lehigh University Enrollment " aria-describedby="This pie chart shows the percentage of undergraduates enrollment for the four largest colleges in 2017 at Lehigh University. The school of Engineering and Applied  Sciences has the largest student body." id="datawrapper-chart-H0GjJ" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/H0GjJ/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;" height="450"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+t);e&&(e.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px")}})}();</script>
