## Hey! My name is Brian. Let's get started.

In 2017, I relocated to Connecticut and now I serve as the Aventri VP of Digital Innovation, leading the company’s digital strategic objectives. In this role, I work to identify and articulate new product and growth opportunities that can transform—and even disrupt—the events market. Recently, I finished writing my book, Takeaways: Secret truths from leading a startup, that will be released in early 2019. I feature my top insights weekly on my personal blog: OWN IT.

Previously, I was the CEO and cofounder of LOOPD, the emerging leader in offline analytics that utilized socially smart wearables and actionable metrics to help marketers understand, target, and interact with customers. Loopd brought a unique twist to analytics by facilitating and documenting two-way live engagement between customers and others at corporate events. 

All of this hard work demands an outlet for release, and I am an avid fan of action sports and outdoor activity. I am a former competitive snowboarder and now I enjoy kiteboarding, mountain biking, and international adventuring, having recently logged trips to India, Iceland, China, Portugal, and Japan.
